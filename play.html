<b>LORD DARLINGTON</b>  How do you do, Lady Windermere?

<b>LADY WINDERMERE</b>  How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.

<b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b>They are quite perfect.  [_Sees a fan lying on the
table_.]  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?

<b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b>  Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?

<b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b>  No?  Is it really?

<b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b>  Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
down.  [_Still arranging flowers_.]

<b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b>  [_Sitting down_.]  I wish I had known it was your
birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for
you.

                                                        [_A short pause_.]

<b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b>  Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the
Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.

<b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b>  I, Lady Windermere?

[_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]

<b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b>  Put it there, Parker.  That will do.  [_Wipes her hands
with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]
Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?

                                                      [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]<br>

<b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b>  [_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]  I am quite
miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.  [_Sits down at
table L._]

<b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b>  Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the
whole evening.

<b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b>  [_Smiling_.]  Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up,
that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only
things we _can_ pay.

<b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b>  [_Shaking her head_.]  No, I am talking very seriously.
You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I
don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when
he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.<br>

<b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b>  Ah, but I did mean them.  [_Takes tea which she offers
him_.

<b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b>  [_Gravely_.]  I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to
quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.
But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men
are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes
think you pretend to be worse.

<b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b>  We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.

<b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b>  Why do you make that your special one?  [_Still seated
at table L._]

        Dear Margaret, I am so pleased to see you. You remember Agatha, don’t you?
        How do you do, Lord Darlington? I won’t let you know
        my daughter, you are far too wicked.Isn’t he dreadful? Agatha, this is Lord Darlington.
        Mind you don’t believe a word he says.
        No, no tea, thank you, dear.We have just
        had tea at Lady Markby’s. Such bad tea, too. It was quite undrinkable.
        I wasn’t at all surprised. Her own son-in-law supplies it. Agatha is
        looking forward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.Of course it’s going to be select.
        But we know _that_, dear Margaret, about _your_ house. It is really one
        of the few houses in London where I can take Agatha, and where I feel
        perfectly secure about dear Berwick. I don’t know what society is coming
        to. The most dreadful people seem to go everywhere. They certainly come
        to my parties—the men get quite furious if one doesn’t ask them. Really,
        some one should make a stand against it.Oh, men don’t matter. With women it is different.
        We’re good. Some of us are, at least. But we are positively getting
        elbowed into the corner. Our husbands would really forget our existence
        if we didn’t nag at them from time to time, just to remind them that we
        have a perfect legal right to do so.The odd trick? Is that the husband, Lord
        Darlington?Dear Lord Darlington, how thoroughly depraved you
        are!What does he mean? Do, as a concession to my poor
        wits, Lord Darlington, just explain to me what you really mean. What a charming,
        wicked creature! I like him so much. I’m quite delighted he’s gone!
        How sweet you’re looking! Where _do_ you get your gowns? And now I must
        tell you how sorry I am for you, dear Margaret. Agatha, darling!Will you go
        and look over the photograph album that I see there?Dear girl! She is so fond
        of photographs of Switzerland. Such a pure taste, I think. But I really am so sorry for
        you, Margaret.Oh, on account of that horrid woman. She dresses so
        well, too, which makes it much worse, sets such a dreadful example.
        Augustus—you know my disreputable brother—such a trial to us all—well,
        Augustus is completely infatuated about her. It is quite scandalous, for
        she is absolutely inadmissible into society. Many a woman has a past,
        but I am told that she has at least a dozen, and that they all fit.About
        Mrs. Erlynne.My poor child! Agatha,darling!Will you go out on the terrace and
        look at the sunset?Sweet girl! So devoted to sunsets! Shows such
        refinement of feeling, does it not? After all, there is nothing like
        Nature, is there?Don’t you really know? I assure you we’re all so
        distressed about it. Only last night at dear Lady Jansen’s every one was
        saying how extraordinary it was that, of all men in London, Windermere
        should behave in such a way.Ah, what indeed, dear? That is the point. He goes
        to see her continually, and stops for hours at a time, and while he is
        there she is not at home to any one. Not that many ladies call on her,
        dear, but she has a great many disreputable men friends—my own brother
        particularly, as I told you—and that is what makes it so dreadful about
        Windermere. We looked upon _him_ as being such a model husband, but I am
        afraid there is no doubt about it. My dear nieces—you know the Saville
        girls, don’t you?—such nice domestic creatures—plain, dreadfully plain,
        but so good—well, they’re always at the window doing fancy work, and
        making ugly things for the poor, which I think so useful of them in these
        dreadful socialistic days, and this terrible woman has taken a house in
        Curzon Street, right opposite them—such a respectable street, too! I
        don’t know what we’re coming to! And they tell me that Windermere goes
        there four and five times a week—they _see_ him. They can’t help it—and
        although they never talk scandal, they—well, of course—they remark on it
        to every one. And the worst of it all is that I have been told that this
        woman has got a great deal of money out of somebody, for it seems that
        she came to London six months ago without anything at all to speak of,
        and now she has this charming house in Mayfair, drives her ponies in the
        Park every afternoon and all—well, all—since she has known poor dear
        Windermere.But it’s quite true, my dear. The whole of London
        knows it. That is why I felt it was better to come and talk to you, and
        advise you to take Windermere away at once to Homburg or to Aix, where
        he’ll have something to amuse him, and where you can watch him all day
        long. I assure you, my dear, that on several occasions after I was first
        married, I had to pretend to be very ill, and was obliged to drink the
        most unpleasant mineral waters, merely to get Berwick out of town. He
        was so extremely susceptible. Though I am bound to say he never gave
        away any large sums of money to anybody. He is far too high-principled
        for that!Ah, the dear pretty baby! How is the little
        darling? Is it a boy or a girl? I hope a girl—Ah, no, I remember it’s a
        boy! I’m so sorry. Boys are so wicked. My boy is excessively immoral.
        You wouldn’t believe at what hours he comes home. And he’s only left
        Oxford a few months—I really don’t know what they teach them there.Oh, all of them,
        my dear, all of them, without any exception. And they never grow any better.
        Men become old, but they never become good.Yes, we begin like that. It was
        only Berwick’s brutal and incessant threats of suicide that made me accept
        him at all,and before the year was out, he was running after all kinds of
        petticoats, every colour, every shape, every material. In fact, before
        the honeymoon was over, I caught him winking at my maid, a most pretty,
        respectable girl. I dismissed her at once without a character.—No, I
        remember I passed her on to my sister; poor dear Sir George is so
        short-sighted, I thought it wouldn’t matter. But it did, though—it was
        most unfortunate. And now, my dear child, I must go, as we
        are dining out. And mind you don’t take this little aberration of
        Windermere’s too much to heart. Just take him abroad, and he’ll come
        back to you all right. Yes, dear, these wicked women get our
        husbands away from us, but they always come back, slightly damaged, of
        course. And don’t make scenes, men hate them!Pretty child! I was like that once.
        Now I know that all men are monsters. The only
        thing to do is to feed the wretches well. A good cook does wonders, and
        that I know you have. My dear Margaret, you are not going to cry?
        That’s quite right, dear. Crying is the refuge of
        plain women but the ruin of pretty ones. Agatha, darling!Come and bid
        good-bye to Lady Windermere, and thank her for your charming visit. And by the way, I
        must thank you for sending a card to Mr. Hopper—he’s that rich young
        Australian people are taking such notice of just at present. His father
        made a great fortune by selling some kind of food in circular tins—most
        palatable, I believe—I fancy it is the thing the servants always refuse
        to eat. But the son is quite interesting. I think he’s attracted by
        dear Agatha’s clever talk. Of course, we should be very sorry to lose
        her, but I think that a mother who doesn’t part with a daughter every
        season has no real affection. We’re coming to-night, dear. And remember
        my advice, take the poor fellow out of town at once, it is the only thing to do.
        Good-bye, once more; come,Agatha.
