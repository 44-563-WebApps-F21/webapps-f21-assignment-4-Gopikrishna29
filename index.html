<h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"><b>LORD DARLINGTON</b></h6>  <p class="speech">How do you do, Lady Windermere?</p>

<h6 class="name LADYWINDERMERE"><b>LADY WINDERMERE</b></h6>  <p class="speech">How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.</p>

<h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"><b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b></h6>  <p class="speech">They are quite perfect.   And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?</p>
<p class="stageDirection">[_Sees a fan lying on the table_.]</p>

<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE"><b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b></h6> <p class="speech">Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?</p>

<h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"><b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b></h6>  <p class="speech">No?  Is it really?</p>

<h6 class="name LADYWINDERMERE"><b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b></h6>  <p class="speech">Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit down.</p>  
<p class="stageDirection">[_Still arranging flowers_.]</p>

<h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"><b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b></h6>   <p class="speech">I wish I had known it was your
birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
front of your house with flowers for you to walk on. They are made for you.</p>
<p class="stageDirection">[_Sitting down_.]</p>

                                                        <p class="stageDirection">[_A short pause_.]</p>

<h6 class="name LADYWINDERMERE"><b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b></h6>  <p class="speech">Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the
Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.</p>

<h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"><b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b></h6> <p class="speech"> I, Lady Windermere?</p>

<p class="stageDirection">[_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]</p>

<h6 class="name LADYWINDERMERE"><b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b></h6>  <p class="speech">Put it there, Parker.  That will do. 
Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?</p>
<p class="stageDirection">[_Wipes her hands with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]</p>

                                                      <p class="stageDirection">[_Exit_ PARKER _C._]</p><br>

<h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"><b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b></h6>  <p class="speech"> I am quite</p>
miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did. 
<p class="stageDirection">[_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]</p> 
<p class="stageDirection">[_Sits down at table L._]</p>

<h6 class="name LADYWINDERMERE"><b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b></h6>  <p class="speech">Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the
whole evening.</p>

<h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"><b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b></h6>   <p class="speech">Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up,
that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only
things we _can_ pay.</p>
<p class="stageDirection">[_Smiling_.]</p>

<h6 class="name LADYWINDERMERE"><b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b></h6>   <p class="speech">No, I am talking very seriously.
You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I
don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when
he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.</p>
<p class="stageDirection">[_Shaking her head_.]</p>

<h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"><b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b></h6>  <p class="speech">Ah, but I did mean them.</p>  
<p class="stageDirection">[_Takes tea which she offers him_.]</p>

<h6 class="name LADYWINDERMERE"><b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b></h6>   <p class="speech">I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to
quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.
But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men
are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes
think you pretend to be worse.</p>
<p class="stageDirection">[_Gravely_.]</p>

<h6 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"><b>LORD DARLINGTON.</b></h6>  <p class="speech">We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYWINDERMERE"><b>LADY WINDERMERE.</b></h6>  <p class="speech">Why do you make that your special one?</p>
<p class="stageDirection">[_Still seated at table L._]</p>
